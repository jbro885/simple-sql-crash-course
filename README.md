# SQL Crash Course

## Gatsby starter genesis.

This is based on Egghead's https://github.com/eggheadio/gatsby-starter-egghead-blog

Which is based on Robin Wieruch's https://github.com/rwieruch/gatsby-mdx-blog-starter-project

Lots of nice pieces are also borrowed from Jason Lengstorf https://github.com/jlengstorf/lengstorf.com

## SQL Quiz component.

This is largely inspired by the sterling work of other SQL online tutorial developers, mainly:

https://github.com/rhc2104/sqlteaching

https://github.com/GKhalsa/sql-fun-time

And many others who blazed the trail.

## Lesson content.

All lessons and quiz questions are by Alan Hylands, a data analyst and author of the [Simple Analytical](https://simpleanalytical.com) blog
